# API-DEVELOPER-HUB

•	This project provides secure API access where users sign up as viewers, complete MFA via email, and access data based on their role (Viewer, Admin, Developer). 
•	Viewers can request to become developers, with admin approval and email-based credentials, while JWT authentication secures developer logins and functionality.
